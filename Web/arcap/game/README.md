# README - ARCap User Interface

The user interface (UI) is implemented in HTML5 using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) and WebSocket.

The file *play.php* renders the overall page, which is styled using *play.css*. *Connection.js* defines a class that provides the methods for communicating with the socket server, while *DpadController.js*, *Dpad.js*, *DpadButton.js*, *SimpleButton.js*, and *StatusMarker.js* define the classes used to create the UI buttons and their corresponding callbacks.
